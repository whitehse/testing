A single node acts as the leader; all data updates flow only through the leader.

For any given epoch, only one leader is guaranteed to exist.

Every data item is associated with the epoch in which it was appended and its index in the log.

A node will not vote for a candidate if it has more up-to-date data than the candidate.

...a majority vote is required to win the election.

CTRL divides the recovery responsibility between two components: the local storage layer and the distributed recovery protocol;

the distributed protocol recovers the data from redundant copies.
