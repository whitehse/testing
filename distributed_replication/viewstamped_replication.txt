VR is intended to work in an asynchronous network, like the Internet, in which
the non-arrival of a message indicates nothing about the state of its sender.
Messages might be lost, delivered late or out of order, and delivered more than
once; however, we assume that if sent repeatedly a message will eventually be
delivered.

VR ensures reliability and availability when no more than a threshold of f
replicas are faulty. It does this by using replica groups of size 2f + 1. Each
step of the protocol must be processed by f + 1 replicas. These f + 1 together
with the f that may not respond give us the smallest group size of 2f + 1.

A group of f + 1 replicas is often referred to as a quorum and correctness of
the protocol depends on the quorum intersection property: the quorum of
replicas that processes a particular step of the protocol must have a non-empty
intersection with the group of replicas available to handle the next step,
since this way we can ensure that at each next step at least one participant
knows what happened in the previous step. In a group of 2f + 1 replicas, f + 1
is the smallest quorum size that will work.  In general a group need not be
exactly of size 2f + 1; if it isn’t, the threshold is the largest f such that
2f + 1 is less than or equal to the group size, K, and a quorum is of size K −
f. However, for a particular threshold f there is no benefit in having a group
of size larger than 2f + 1: a larger group requires larger quorums to ensure
intersection, but does not tolerate more failures. Therefore in the protocol
descriptions in this paper we assume the group size is exactly 2f + 1.
