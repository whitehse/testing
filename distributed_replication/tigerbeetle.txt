Describe to me the underlying architecture of the TigerBeetle database system.
Please include discussion of the systems-level decisions made in the design. 

TigerBeetle is a high-performance, distributed financial accounting database designed for low-latency, high-throughput transaction processing. Its architecture is optimized for the specific needs of financial systems, where consistency, durability, and performance are critical. Below is an overview of its underlying architecture and the key systems-level decisions made in its design:

1. Consensus and Replication
Consensus Protocol: TigerBeetle uses a consensus protocol (likely inspired by Paxos or Raft) to ensure strong consistency across replicas. This ensures that all nodes in the cluster agree on the order of transactions, which is critical for financial systems.

Quorum-Based Replication: Data is replicated across multiple nodes to ensure fault tolerance. Writes are acknowledged only after a quorum of nodes has confirmed the transaction, balancing consistency and availability.

Leader-Follower Model: A leader node coordinates writes and ensures that all followers are in sync. This simplifies the coordination of distributed transactions.

2. Storage Engine
Log-Structured Storage: TigerBeetle employs a log-structured storage engine, which appends all writes sequentially to a log. This design is highly efficient for write-heavy workloads, as it minimizes disk seeks and maximizes throughput.

Immutable Data: Once written, data is immutable, which simplifies concurrency control and ensures consistency. Updates are handled by appending new versions of records rather than modifying existing ones.

Compaction: To manage disk space and maintain performance, TigerBeetle periodically compacts the log by removing obsolete records and merging data.

3. Data Model
Double-Entry Accounting: TigerBeetle is designed around the principles of double-entry accounting, where every transaction affects at least two accounts (debit and credit). This ensures that the system maintains a balanced ledger at all times.

Atomic Transactions: Transactions are atomic, meaning that either all changes in a transaction are applied, or none are. This guarantees the integrity of the ledger.

Idempotency: TigerBeetle supports idempotent operations, allowing clients to safely retry transactions without fear of duplicate effects.

4. Performance Optimization
Zero-Copy I/O: TigerBeetle leverages zero-copy techniques to minimize CPU overhead and memory usage when reading and writing data. This is particularly important for high-throughput systems.

Batching: Transactions are processed in batches to amortize the cost of I/O operations and improve throughput.

Memory-Mapped Files: TigerBeetle uses memory-mapped files to efficiently manage on-disk data structures, reducing the need for explicit read/write system calls.

**NOTE: This appears to be incorrect

5. Fault Tolerance and Durability
Write-Ahead Logging (WAL): All transactions are first written to a write-ahead log before being applied to the main data store. This ensures durability and allows for recovery in the event of a crash.

Checksumming: Data is checksummed to detect and prevent corruption, ensuring data integrity.

Snapshotting: Periodic snapshots are taken to reduce recovery time and minimize the amount of log replay required after a failure.

6. Distributed Design
Partitioning: TigerBeetle partitions data across nodes to distribute the load and scale horizontally. Each partition is responsible for a subset of the data.

Coordination-Free Reads: Reads can often be served locally without requiring coordination with other nodes, reducing latency.

Global Consistency: Despite partitioning, TigerBeetle ensures global consistency through its consensus protocol and replication mechanisms.

7. Language and Runtime
Zig Programming Language: TigerBeetle is implemented in Zig, a modern systems programming language that emphasizes safety, performance, and simplicity. Zig's low-level control and lack of runtime overhead make it well-suited for building high-performance databases.

No Garbage Collection: By avoiding garbage collection, TigerBeetle achieves predictable performance and low latency, which are critical for financial systems.

8. Client API
Simple and Efficient: TigerBeetle provides a simple and efficient API for clients to interact with the database. The API is designed to minimize overhead and latency.

Language Bindings: While the core is written in Zig, TigerBeetle supports client libraries in multiple languages, making it accessible to a wide range of applications.

Key Systems-Level Decisions
Specialization for Financial Workloads: TigerBeetle is purpose-built for financial accounting, which allows it to make optimizations that general-purpose databases cannot.

Log-Structured Design: The choice of a log-structured storage engine prioritizes write performance and simplifies consistency management.

Consistency Over Availability: TigerBeetle prioritizes strong consistency and durability, even at the cost of some availability, as required by financial systems.

Use of Zig: The decision to use Zig reflects a focus on performance, safety, and control over the runtime environment.

Distributed but Consistent: TigerBeetle balances the need for horizontal scalability with the requirement for global consistency, ensuring that the system can scale without compromising correctness.

Conclusion
TigerBeetle's architecture is a carefully crafted blend of distributed systems principles, performance optimizations, and domain-specific design choices. Its focus on financial accounting workloads allows it to achieve exceptional performance and reliability, making it a compelling choice for applications requiring high-throughput, low-latency transaction processing.
